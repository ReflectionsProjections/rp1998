<P>
Many technologies originally developed to help people with disabilities led 
to the development of many of today’s information products.  For example:

<B><P>1808</P></B>
<P>The first <B>typewriter</B> was built by Pellegrino Turri in 1808 to 
enable a friend of his who was <B>blind</B>, Countess Carolina Fantoni da 
Fivizzono, to write legibly.</P>
<B><P>1873</P> </B>
<P>Herman Hollerith, a young student, with what is now recognized as having 
had <B>learning</B> <B>disabilities</B>, jumps from a second story window 
to avoid a spelling lesson.  Seventeen years later Hollerith developed a 
system to &quot;overcome the challenge of processing data manually.&quot;  
He incorporated ideas from Jacquard's loom and Babbage's Analytical 
Engine and patented an electromechanical information machine that used 
punched cards. It won the 1890 U.S. Census competition, with the result 
that electricity was used for the first time in a major data-processing 
project.  He invention ultimately became known as the <B>computer</B>.

<B><P>1876</P> </B>
<P>Throughout his life, Alexander Graham Bell had been interested in the 
education of people who were <B>deaf</B>.  This interest lead him to invent 
the <B>microphone</B> and, in 1876, his "electrical speech machine," which 
we now call a <B>telephone</B>. Alexander Graham Bell's telephone receives 
U.S. Patent 174,465, the most lucrative patent ever granted.</P>
<B><P>1931</P> </B>
<P>Books for the <B>Blind</B> developed "specialized playback machines" to 
give patrons access to books. We now call these devices <B>tape recorders</B>.
</P>
<B><P>1945</P> </B>
<P>World War II Teletype machines began to be used by people who are 
<B>deaf</B> and those they wished to communicate with the deaf to communicate 
over the telephone.  When calling someone it was routine for the caller to 
identify who you were along with their telephone number before the person 
receiving the call answered.  This was the beginning of what we now know as 
<B>caller ID</B>.</P>
<B><P>1972</P> </B>
<P>Vinton Cerf developed the host level protocols for the ARPANET.  ARPANET 
was the first large scale packet network.  Cerf, hard-of-hearing since birth, 
married a profoundly <B>deaf</B> lady by the name of Sigrid.  Cerf 
communicated with his wife using a teletypewriter for text messaging over 
ARPANET.  Had it not been for Cerf developing a way to communicate with 
Sigrid, <B>e-mail</B> may not have been part of the initial release of 
ARPANET, the precursor to Internet.  On another note, Cerf’s work led to 
the term, &quot;Cerfing the net.&quot;</P>
<B><P>1976</P> </B>
<P>Kurzweil Computer Products made an agreement with the American Foundation 
for the <B>Blind</B>.  As a result they developed the Kurzweil Reading 
Machine, a <B>flat-bed scanner</B> which reads aloud any printed text that 
is presented to it.  Based on Omnifont-Character-Recognition (OCR) 
technology, it was intended to be a sensory aid for the blind  Kurzweil's 
scanner gave him the equivalent of a 10 year competitive advantage in this 
field.</P>
<B><P>1991</P> </B>
<P>Dragon Systems develops and markets a <B>speech recognition</B> product 
designed to enable people <B>without the use of their hands</B> to access 
to computers though the use of their voice. </P>
<B><P>1994</P> </B>
<P>Both a European and an American consortium, devoted to providing 
next-generation "Talking Books for the <B>Blind</B>," developed the first 
<B>Digital Talking Books</B> (DTB). This technology will ultimately replace 
audio cassette tapes.  It will also enable companies to store massive 
amounts of audio information, searchable by word,  in data warehouses.</P>
<B><P>1995</P> </B>
<P>The first <B>talking pager</B> was developed by Desktop Paging Software.  
The system, called Neuropage, delivered messages in voice to meet the 
specific needs of persons who are <B>blind</B> and <B>visually</B>-
<B>impaired</B> where text formats would not be appropriate.</P>
<B><P>1995</P> </B>
<P>HITEC developed the<B> talking caller ID</B>, a new I.D. box that speaks 
the date, time and number of the calling party.  The system was designed to 
meet the needs of the <B>blind</B> and <B>visually-impaired</B>.</P>
<B><P>1995</P> </B>
<P>A company by the name of Productivity Works, develops PW Webspeak, a 
non-visual web browser.  It revolutionizes the way people who are <B>blind</B> 
access and use the Internet.  This product is now being used to <B>access 
the web, using a standard telephone</B>.  This is a perfect port-of-entry 
for business people on the go.</P>
