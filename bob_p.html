<B>The Personal Software Process - Bob Pauwels</B></A></A><P>

<I>Abstract</I>
<P>
Software can be found in more products today than ever.  As software becomes more pervasive, the issue of quality, predictability, and cycle time has become critical to every business, whether software is their
primary product or not.  Unfortunately, most software projects are delivered late, are over budget, and are of poor quality.  The Personal Software Process attacks these issues by teaching software engineers and managers a basic skill set in state-of-the-art software engineering and project management practices; most of which are not taught to software engineering students while they are in college.
