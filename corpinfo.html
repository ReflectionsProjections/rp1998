For the last three years, the student chapter of the <A href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/">Association for Computing Machinery</a> at the University of Illinois has hosted Reflections | Projections.  Each year, the conference has been a resounding success, thanks to the support of students, faculty, corporate sponsors, and keynote speakers Steve Wozniak, Jean-Louis Gasse (who spoke via proxy), and Steve Dorner.  In addition to the variety of talks and an exciting programming contest entitled MechMania, we hold a computing employment fair.  The fair was attended by 34 corporations in 1997 and over 500 students members from across the midwest.
</p>
<p>
This year, we are holding the fourth annual conference on October 2-4, 1998.  After the success of last year's employment fair, we have decided to once again make it a whole-day event on Friday, October 2.  The employment fair is targeted at careers in computing-related fields and will be attended by both University of Illinois students at large and conference participants from throughout the country.
</p>
<p>
We are looking for your help to fund the conference and to keep student admission costs low.  We ask that corporations attending the employment fair donate a minimum of $250 to help cover the costs of the fair and the conference.  Corporations donating in excess of $750 will become "Official Conference Sponsors," have optimal placement in the employment fair, and receive top billing on ACM@UIUC's web server, which receives over 50,000 hits per day. All participating companies will have full access to conference events and receive a conference resume book.
